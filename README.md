1. You can use any distribution from VigrantCloud that supported by Easy Engine. I am using ubuntu/precise32. To change Distribution open the Vigrantfile and replace ubutnu/precise with box name

```bash
mkdir easyengine-vagrant
cd easyengine-vagrant
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gau1991/easyengine-vagrant/master/Vagrantfile
```

2. Now Start the Vagrant
